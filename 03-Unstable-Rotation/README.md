### Unstable Rotation In Unity 5 ###

+ The limitations of spinning objects in Unity 5.
+ Why unstable rotation doesn't evolve.
+ How to model unstable rotation in game physics.

### Introducing Inertia Tensors ###

+ Roughly what is an inertia tensor (**I**)?
+ Unstable intermediate axis
+ How Unity Calculates **I**
+ Calculate **I** for your phone
+ Predict it's unstable axis

### Calculating Moment Of Inertia ###

+ How about if two axis are equal?
+ Try it with a spinning cylinder.
+ Calculate the moment of inertia.
+ Render vs. collider mesh influence.

### Parallel Axis Theorem ###

+ NOT the same as Intermediate Axis Theorem.
+ How to calculate I for compound objects.
+ Think of a discus thrower.
+ [Parallel Axis Theorem - Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_axis_theorem)

### “Newton’s Laws Of Rotation” ###

+ A recap of Newton's laws of motion.
+ How these relation to rotation.
+ Important differences.
+ Why we're jumping in the deep end!

### Applying Torque To Rigidbodies ###

+ How to use Unity's **AddTorque()** method.
+ How Inertia Tensor affects rotation.
+ Comparing the rotation of two objects.

### Vector Cross Products ###

+ What a cross product is.
+ Why they are so useful.
+ Using WolframAlpha to calculate.

### The Magnus Effect ###

+ What the Magnus Effect is.
+ How we can approximate ball flight with it.
+ Using **Vector3.Cross** in Unity.
